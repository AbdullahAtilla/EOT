EOT (Eye Of the Tiger) is a computer vision project that aimed reading data on the counters and meters. You can find all the instructions and explanations in the 'Documentation' folder.

The application has two version; For computers and For Raspberry Pi.

If you want to use the application on your computer, clone 'master' branch. Otherwise, clone 'rpi' branch for your Raspberry Pi.

The application has tested on Ubuntu on a laptop and Ubuntu MATE on a Raspberry Pi 3.

For better results;

**Use an embedded Pi Camera if you use the program on your Raspberry Pi.

**Be careful about shining on the counter during image capture

**Distance between counter and camera should be 15cm for the best result

**The application is optimized for the small rotations, but big rotations on image capture will not give a result.

**Ensure that the counters data field has cleared from dusts. It is not very important but that may cause wrong results.

Usage is explained on the Documentation folder at the ReadME.txt file.
